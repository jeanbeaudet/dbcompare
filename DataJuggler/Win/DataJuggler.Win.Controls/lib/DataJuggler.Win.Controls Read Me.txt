This file is part of DataJuggler.Net.Controls which include:
DataJuggler.Win.Controls
DataJuggler.Web.Controls
DataJuggler.WPF.Controls

Most of the controls have similar properties but the Web Controls have been used in production more so they are the most developed.
The code in Nuget is slightly ahead of the source code CodePlex: https://datajugglercontrols.codeplex.com/

In all of the environments the most tested controls are:
LabelTextBoxControl
LabelComboBox

If you would like the most updated version of the source code email corby@datajuggler.com and I will update code plex.

If you find any bugs send me them to me and if you know the solution include that with your bug report as that 
great expedites the update process.

If you add any controls or features I will put a spell of good fortune upon you that will last for all of your remaining days on this earth.
